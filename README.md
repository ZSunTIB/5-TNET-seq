# 5-TNET-seq
Directions and custom scripts to process the 5'TNET-seq data. The raw fastq.gz files obtained on an NovaSeq 6000 platform (2 Ã— 50 bp paired end) were processed to find the pause sites, extract the reads derived from productive reiterative initatioin and calculate the slippage ratio for each TSS region.
